# Noah Protocol

> Privacy-preserving KYC for the Multi-Chain Future on Avalanche.

Noah is a decentralized identity protocol that enables **"Verify Once, Use Everywhere"** identity verification. By leveraging Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKP), Noah allows users to prove attributes (like age or citizenship) without revealing their underlying data.

## Core Components

- **CredentialRegistry.sol**: RBAC-secured registry for identity-wallet bindings.
- **ProtocolAccessControl.sol**: On-chain gateway for setting and verifying identity requirements.
- **ZK Prover (Gnark)**: Client-side WASM prover for generating Groth16 proofs.
- **Noah SDK**: High-level TypeScript library for proving and granting access.
